import Offsets from '@site/src/components/Offsets';

## Overview

This page attempts to collate the offsets found in [this thread](https://the-starport.net/freelancer/forum/viewtopic.php?topic_id=2987) into a single, searchable database.

The crash offsets are available as a [JSON payload](/payloads/crash-offsets.json) should you want to use them in automatic crash detection.

## Finding Your Crash Offset

In order to get the offset from a crash:

* Press Win + R, enter 'eventvwr.msc' and hit okay.
* Go to Windows Logs, then Application Logs and search for your crash.
* Under the 'general' tab, note the faulting module name (i.e.common.dll) and the fault offset(i.e. 0x000d21eb).

If you're using the event viewer for this a lot, you can use the following xml filter to only show errors generated by Freelancer.exe and flserver.exe:

```xml
<QueryList>
  <Query Id="0" Path="Application">
    <Select Path="Application">*[System[(Level=2) and (EventID=1000)]] and *[EventData[Data and (Data='Freelancer.exe' or Data='flserver.exe')]]</Select>
  </Query>
</QueryList>
```
